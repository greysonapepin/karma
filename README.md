# karma
karma is module that interacts with .adeth to allow it to run. It is a module to build off and create simular scripts as .adeth. karma uses Time, Pyautogui, Colorama and Keyboard.

I would recommend to import karma as ka for a better experience

To see all current scripts in this module use the karma.func_list()
