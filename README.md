# karmaMC
karmaMC is module that interacts with .adeth It is a module to build off and create simular scripts as .adeth. karmaMC uses Time, Pyautogui, Colorama and Keyboard.

I would recommend to import karmaMC as kamc for a better experience

To see all current scripts in this module use the karmaMC.func_list()
